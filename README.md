# Wauchier_stylo


Stylometric analysis of Old French _l√©gendiers_.

N.B.: the `data` folder contains data generated with `stylo` from the raw text data.
If you need to generate new data, you will need to run the (commented-out) commands using stylo, 
and then use `write.csv` to save them / `read.csv` to load them.
